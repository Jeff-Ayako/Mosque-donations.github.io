					<h1>The Importance Of Mosques</h1>
					<blockquote>&ldquo;At Muslim Global Relief, we know that without personal and spiritual development, there can be no social development. In most of the villages we work, mosques are the places where personal and spiritual development happens. Mosques also double as community centres and places of learning. It’s where people are united in worship, where men and women come to for solace and support, and where children learn to read. Mosques are the centre of any community where people can congregate for their five daily prayers and Friday congregation sermons. A mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together not only for prayers, but for information, education and meetings..&rdquo;</blockquote>
